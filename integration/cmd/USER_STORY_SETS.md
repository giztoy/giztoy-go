# CLI User Story Sets

## Goal

`integration/cmd/` contains process-level CLI integration tests driven by `go test`.

Each story set should verify real user workflows by:

- starting real `gizclaw` subprocesses
- using an isolated virtual `HOME`
- using an isolated `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
- using a story-owned server workspace and config
- keeping all runtime artifacts inside the test harness sandbox

## Story Set Layout

Each story directory should contain:

- `USER_STORIES.md`
- one or more `*_test.go` files
- optional story-owned config fixtures

The shared process harness lives in:

- `integration/cmd/test_harness.go`

## Case Naming Convention

Use one directory per case:

- `000-ping`
- `001-ping-reconnect`
- `100-context-create-use-list`

Recommended rule:

- `000-099`: connectivity smoke
- `100-199`: context lifecycle
- `200-299`: server workspace lifecycle
- `300-399`: single-client workflows
- `400-499`: multi-client workflows
- `500-599`: admin and gear workflows
- `600-699`: idempotency and repeatability
- `700-799`: failure and recovery

Each case directory should describe:

- what long-running processes are started
- what CLI commands are executed
- whether the scenario is sequential or concurrent
- what user-visible outcome is expected

## Planned Story Sets

### `000-*` Connectivity Smoke

Purpose:
- prove the basic CLI workflow is alive end to end

  - run small concurrent ping across two clients
  - status: implemented
- `001-ping-reconnect`
  - start one server
  - create one client context
  - run `ping`
  - stop and restart the server with the same workspace
  - run `ping` again and verify the same context still works
  - status: implemented
- `002-ping-multi-round`
  - start one server
  - create multiple client contexts
  - run several rounds of sequential then concurrent `ping`
  - verify the server remains healthy across repeated rounds

## Ordering Strategy

Recommended implementation order:

1. `000-*` connectivity smoke
2. `100-*` context lifecycle
3. `200-*` server workspace lifecycle
4. `700-*` failure and recovery
5. `400-*` multi-client coordination
6. `600-*` idempotency and repeatability
7. `300-*` single-client public workflows
8. `500-*` admin and gear workflows

## Design Notes

- Early story sets should prefer narrow, reliable workflows over broad coverage.
- Concurrency stories should start with a small number of clients and commands, then expand gradually.
- Each story set should own its fixture config rather than relying on shared mutable global state.
- Story sets should stay readable as user workflows first, harness mechanics second.
- A case should test one coherent user behavior, not an entire product surface.
- If one case grows multiple independent assertions, split it into multiple directories.
